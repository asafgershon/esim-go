## Git Commit Guidelines
When making commits, organize changes by feature and create clean, focused commits:

1. **Stage specific files**: Use `git add <specific-files>` to stage only related changes
2. **Review staged files**: Use `git diff --cached --name-only` to review what will be committed
3. **Commit format**: Use descriptive commit messages with this structure:
   ```
   type: brief description
   
   - Detailed bullet points of what was changed
   - Include file locations for major changes
   - Explain the "why" not just the "what"

4. **Separate concerns**: Create separate commits for different features (e.g., validation flow vs URL state management)
5. **Include context**: Reference relevant documentation or API recommendations when applicable
