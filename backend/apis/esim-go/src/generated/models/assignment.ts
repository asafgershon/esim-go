/**
 * eSIM Go API
 * To access the eSIMGo API, you need to authenticate your requests using an API key.  Here\'s a brief overview of the authentication process:   1. Assuming that you have created account already:   - Log into your eSIMGo account at https://sso.esim-go.com/login.   - Navigate to Account Settings -> API Details to find your API key.   - Keep your API key secure and avoid sharing it with others.   2. API Key Usage:   - Include your API key in the header of all eSIMGo API requests.   - Use the header key \'X-API-KEY\' with your API key as the value.   3. Security Scheme:   - The eSIMGo API uses an HTTP security scheme type for authentication.   4. Authorization Types:   - The API supports \'apiKeyAuth\' authorization type.
