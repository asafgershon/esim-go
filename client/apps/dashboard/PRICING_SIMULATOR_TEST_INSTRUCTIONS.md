# Pricing Simulator Test Instructions

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive testing instructions for the Pricing Simulator implementation in the eSIM Go dashboard, including automated Puppeteer tests and manual verification steps.

## Prerequisites

1. **Dashboard Running**: Ensure the dashboard is running locally
   ```bash
   cd /Users/yarinsa/Code/esim-go/client/apps/dashboard
   bun run dev
   ```
   The dashboard should be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`

2. **Backend Services**: Ensure the GraphQL backend is running with pricing simulation endpoints

## Automated Testing

### Option 1: Quick Setup with Installation Script
```bash
# Make the script executable (if not already)
chmod +x run-test.sh

# Run the test (this will install Puppeteer if needed)
./run-test.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup
```bash
# Install Puppeteer
bun add puppeteer --dev

# Run the test
node pricing-simulator-test.js
```

## What the Automated Test Checks

### ‚úÖ Core Functionality Tests

1. **Page Navigation**: Navigates to `/pricing/simulator`
2. **UI Elements Verification**:
   - Country selector dropdown
   - Days input field 
   - Payment method selector
   - Run Simulation button

3. **Interaction Testing**:
   - Selects a country (US or IL)
   - Sets days to 7
   - Selects a payment method
   - Clicks "Run Simulation"

4. **Results Verification**:
   - Checks for simulation results display
   - Verifies tabs interface (Summary, Breakdown, Steps)
   - Tests Steps tab functionality
   - Verifies steps panel scrollability

5. **Real-time Features**:

   - Verifies streaming/real-time updates
   - Monitors step-by-step calculation updates

6. **Error Monitoring**:
   - Captures console errors/warnings
   - Tracks network request failures
   - Reports JavaScript errors

### üì∏ Screenshots Generated

The test creates a `test-screenshots` directory with:
- `01-initial-page.png` - Initial page state
- `02-before-simulation.png` - Form filled, ready to simulate
- `03-after-simulation.png` - Results displayed
- `error-screenshot.png` - If errors occur
- `test-report.json` - Detailed test results

- Count-up animations for price changes  
- Discount display with savings amounts
- Responsive layout on mobile devices

## Troubleshooting
