# AirHalo API Integration - Implementation Summary

## üéØ **Status: READY FOR CREDENTIALS**

The AirHalo API integration has been **fully implemented** and is ready for production deployment once API credentials are configured.

## ‚úÖ **What's Been Completed**

### Backend Implementation
- **‚úÖ AirHalo API Client Package** (`/server/packages/airhalo-client/`)
  - Complete TypeScript client generated from OpenAPI spec
  - Custom wrapper class with authentication management
  - Enhanced features: search, filtering, similarity matching
- **‚úÖ GraphQL Integration** (`/server/server/`)
  - Schema extensions for AirHalo data types
  - Resolvers for package fetching and comparison
  - Proper error handling and context integration
- **‚úÖ Testing Infrastructure**
  - Comprehensive unit tests for client and resolvers
  - Integration tests for GraphQL queries
  - All tests use mocks - no external API dependencies

### Frontend Implementation
- **‚úÖ Dashboard Integration** (`/client/apps/dashboard/`)
  - New "AirHalo Pricing" tab added to pricing page
  - Responsive table with filtering capabilities
  - Country and package type filters
  - Loading states and error handling
- **‚úÖ GraphQL Queries**
  - Complete query definitions for AirHalo data
  - TypeScript types generated from schema
- **‚úÖ Component Testing**
  - React component tests with mock providers
  - E2E test scenarios for user workflows

## üöÄ **Next Steps for Agent**

### 1. **Environment Configuration** (Required)
Add these environment variables to your production and development environments:

```env
# AirHalo API Credentials
AIRHALO_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
AIRHALO_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
AIRHALO_BASE_URL=https://api.airalo.com
```

### 2. **Testing with Real API** (Optional)
Once credentials are available:
- Test the GraphQL queries in the dashboard
- Verify data is displaying correctly
- Check error handling with invalid credentials

### 3. **Production Deployment** (Ready)
The feature is ready to deploy and will:
- Gracefully handle missing credentials
- Show appropriate error states
- Work seamlessly once credentials are added
