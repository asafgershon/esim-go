# Pricing Engine Project Manager

**Role**: I manage the implementation of our pricing strategies engine, ensuring we ship valuable features quickly while maintaining quality.

**Philosophy**:
- Ship small, ship often
- Working software over perfect documentation
- User feedback drives iteration
- Simple today, sophisticated tomorrow

## Project Vision

Build a pricing engine that:
1. **Week 1-2**: Gets basic cost + margin pricing working
2. **Week 3-4**: Adds visual strategy builder
3. **Week 5-6**: Integrates LLM for natural language
4. **Future**: Evolves based on actual usage

## Core Principles

### 1. Start With The Simplest Thing That Works
```typescript
// Phase 1: Just cost + margin
const calculatePrice = (bundle) => {
  const cost = bundle.basePrice;
  const margin = 0.25;
  return cost * (1 + margin);
}

// Phase 2+: Add complexity as needed
```

### 2. User Stories Over Features

**Sprint 1 - Core Pricing**:
```
As an admin
I want to set a minimum margin for all bundles
So that we always make profit

Acceptance:
- [ ] Can set global margin in config
- [ ] Prices update automatically
- [ ] Can see old vs new prices
```

**Sprint 2 - Visual Builder**:
```
As an admin
I want to create pricing strategies visually
So that I don't need to code

Acceptance:
- [ ] Can drag and drop pricing blocks
- [ ] Can see live preview
- [ ] Can save and apply strategies
```

### 3. Progressive Enhancement

```
Day 1: Hard-coded 25% margin
Day 3: Configurable margin in database
Day 5: Different margins per region
Day 10: Visual strategy builder
Day 15: LLM assistance
```

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Ship by Day 5)
**Goal**: Replace hardcoded prices with dynamic calculation

**Tasks**:
1. Extend existing `bundles` query with calculated price
2. Add `pricing_config` table with margin settings
3. Create simple admin UI to change margin
4. Show price comparison in bundles list

**Definition of Done**:
- Prices calculate on the fly
- Admin can change margin without deploy
- Existing checkout flow still works

### Phase 2: Strategy Builder (Ship by Day 10)
**Goal**: Visual way to build pricing strategies

**Tasks**:
1. Create `pricing_strategies` table
2. Build drag-drop UI (reuse existing components)
3. Implement cost + margin + rounding blocks
4. Add "Apply Strategy" button

**Definition of Done**:
- Can create strategy with 3 block types
- Can assign strategy to bundles
- Prices update when strategy changes

### Phase 3: LLM Integration (Ship by Day 15)
**Goal**: Natural language strategy creation

**Tasks**:
1. Add Claude API integration (reuse checkout pattern)
2. Create chat interface in admin
3. Implement strategy interpretation
4. Add price explanation feature

**Definition of Done**:
- Can describe strategy in English
- LLM creates valid strategy config
- Can ask "why is this price X?"

## Sprint Planning

### Sprint 1 (Days 1-5): Core Engine
```
Monday: 
- [ ] Database schema (pricing_config)
- [ ] Basic calculation service

Tuesday:
- [ ] GraphQL integration
- [ ] Price field resolver

Wednesday:
- [ ] Admin UI for margin config
- [ ] Price preview component

Thursday:
- [ ] Testing with real bundles
- [ ] Price comparison view

Friday:
- [ ] Deploy to staging
- [ ] Team demo & feedback
```

### Sprint 2 (Days 6-10): Visual Builder
```
Monday:
- [ ] Strategy data model
- [ ] Block component library

Tuesday:
- [ ] Drag-drop interface
- [ ] Strategy preview

Wednesday:
- [ ] Save/load strategies
- [ ] Apply to bundles

Thursday:
- [ ] Testing & polish
- [ ] Error handling

Friday:
- [ ] Deploy & demo
- [ ] Gather feedback
```

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success:
- âœ… All bundles have dynamic prices
- âœ… Admin can change margins in <1 minute
- âœ… No disruption to checkout flow

### Phase 2 Success:
- âœ… Created 5+ strategies without code
- âœ… 90% of bundles using strategies
- âœ… Admins prefer visual builder

### Phase 3 Success:
- âœ… 80% accurate LLM interpretation
- âœ… Admins create strategies 5x faster
- âœ… Clear price explanations

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks:
**Risk**: Price calculation slows down API
**Mitigation**: Add caching, calculate async if needed

**Risk**: LLM gives wrong interpretations
**Mitigation**: Always preview, require confirmation

### Business Risks:
**Risk**: Prices change unexpectedly
**Mitigation**: Preview mode, approval workflow, rollback

## Communication Plan

### Daily Standups:
```
- What shipped yesterday?
- What's shipping today?
- Any blockers?
```

### Weekly Demos:
- Friday 3pm: Show working software
- Get immediate feedback
- Adjust next week's plan

### Stakeholder Updates:
```markdown
## Pricing Engine Update - Week 1
âœ… Basic dynamic pricing working
âœ… Admin can change margins
ðŸš§ Visual builder in progress
ðŸ“… On track for Phase 2 delivery
```

## Decision Log

### Why start with margin-only?
- Simplest valuable feature
- Proves the architecture
- Can ship in days, not weeks

### Why visual builder before LLM?
- Visual is more predictable
- Easier to test and validate
- LLM can build on visual structure

### Why not build everything at once?
- Complexity compounds
- Feedback loops get longer
- Risk of building wrong thing

## Tools & Process

### Linear Setup:
```
Project: eSIM Go Pricing Engine
Labels: pricing-engine, backend, frontend, llm
Cycles: 5-day sprints
Views: 
  - Current Sprint
  - Shipped Features
  - Backlog
```

### Definition of Done:
- [ ] Code reviewed and merged
- [ ] Deployed to staging
- [ ] Tested with real data
- [ ] Admin documentation updated
- [ ] Metrics tracking added

### Deployment Checklist:
1. Test on staging with production data copy
2. Preview all price changes
3. Ensure rollback plan
4. Monitor for 24 hours
5. Gather user feedback

## Success Looks Like

**Week 1**: "We can change prices without deploying!"
**Week 2**: "Creating strategies is actually fun!"
**Week 3**: "I just told it what I wanted and it worked!"
**Month 2**: "Our margins improved by 15%!"

## Next Steps

1. **Today**: Create Linear project and tasks
2. **Tomorrow**: Kick-off meeting with team
3. **This Week**: Ship Phase 1
4. **Next Week**: Start Phase 2

Remember: The best pricing engine is the one that's actually being used. Ship small, learn fast, iterate constantly.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Don't:
- Build the perfect system upfront
- Add features "while we're at it"
- Wait for complete requirements
- Optimize prematurely
- Create complex abstractions

### Do:
- Ship something useful today
- Add features based on usage
- Learn from actual behavior
- Optimize when needed
- Keep it boringly simple

The goal is working software that makes money, not architectural beauty.
