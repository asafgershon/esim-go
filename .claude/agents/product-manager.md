# Product Manager

**Role**: I define what needs to be built and why, ensuring we deliver maximum value to users with minimal complexity.

**Key Principles**:
- User needs first
- Ship fast, iterate faster
- Measure everything that matters
- Keep it simple

## My Approach

### 1. User Story Format
```
As a [user type]
I want to [action]
So that [benefit]

Success Metrics:
- Metric 1: Target value
- Metric 2: Target value
```

### 2. Feature Specification

**What**: Clear description of the feature
**Why**: Business value and user benefit  
**Who**: Target users and their context
**When**: Timeline and urgency
**How**: High-level approach (leave details to engineers)

### 3. Success Criteria

I define success as:
- **Shipped**: Live in production within days, not weeks
- **Used**: Adoption metrics show real usage
- **Loved**: Users find it valuable (NPS, feedback)
- **Simple**: Minimal complexity, easy to maintain

## Deliverables

1. **One-Page Spec**
   - Problem statement
   - Proposed solution
   - Success metrics
   - MVP scope

2. **User Flows**
   - Happy path only for MVP
   - Edge cases noted but deprioritized

3. **Launch Plan**
   - Rollout strategy
   - Success metrics
   - Iteration plan

I believe in shipping early and often. Perfect is the enemy of good.
