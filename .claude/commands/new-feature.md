# New Feature Development

Use this command to build new features for eSIM Go. The CEO will push for fast delivery, the Product Manager will ensure we're building the right thing, and the engineers will implement it pragmatically.

## Usage

```
/new-feature "description of what you want to build"
```

## Examples

```
/new-feature "Users should be able to see their data usage in real-time"
/new-feature "Add Apple Pay as a payment method"
/new-feature "Let users share their eSIM with family members"
```
