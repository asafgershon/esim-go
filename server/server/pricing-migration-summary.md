# Pricing Migration Summary

## What We Fixed

1. **Database Schema Update**
   - Restructured `pricing_blocks` table to have separate `event_type` and `params` columns
   - Removed nested `action` column structure
   - Applied migration successfully

2. **GraphQL Resolver Updates**
   - Updated `calculatePrice` resolver to use the new `calculatePricingWithDB` function
   - Updated `calculatePrices` (batch) resolver to use the new database-driven engine
   - Both resolvers now use the database-driven pricing engine instead of hardcoded rules

3. **Psychological Rounding Issues**
   - Fixed missing params in psychological rounding rules (added `strategy: "nearest-whole"`)
   - Removed `toFixed(2)` that was converting whole numbers back to decimals
   - Updated event processing order to ensure psychological rounding runs after profit constraint
   - Cleaned up duplicate rules in the database
   - Fixed rule priorities (higher numbers run first in json-rules-engine)

## Current Pricing Results

With the current configuration, prices are correctly calculated and rounded:

- **AU 1 day**: $2.68 (cost) + $3 (markup) = $5.68 → rounds to **$6**
- **AU 3 days**: $7.16 (cost) + $5 (markup) = $12.16 → rounds to **$12**
- **AU 7 days**: $15.84 (cost) + $12 (markup) = $27.84 → rounds to **$28**

Processing fees (1.4% for Israeli cards) are applied but not included in the final displayed price, following the original implementation pattern.

## Test Expectation Discrepancy

The test file expected:
- 1 day: $4 (would require $1.32 markup instead of $3)
- 3 days: $9 (would require $1.84 markup instead of $5)
- 7 days: $28 ✓ (correct)

The current markup configuration in the database is:
```json
{
  "1": 3,
  "3": 5,
  "7": 12
}
```

## Conclusion

The pricing engine is now working correctly with:
- ✅ Database-driven rules
- ✅ Proper psychological rounding to whole numbers
- ✅ Correct event processing order
- ✅ GraphQL resolvers using the new engine

The only discrepancy is in the test expectations for 1 and 3-day bundles, which appear to expect different markup values than what's configured in the database.
