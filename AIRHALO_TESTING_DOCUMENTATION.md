# AirHalo Integration Testing Documentation

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy implemented for the AirHalo API integration in the eSIM Go platform.

## Overview

The AirHalo integration has been tested at multiple levels to ensure reliability, maintainability, and excellent user experience:

1. **Unit Tests** - Backend GraphQL resolvers and AirHalo client
2. **Component Tests** - Frontend React components
3. **Integration Tests** - End-to-end GraphQL query flows
4. **E2E Tests** - Complete user journey simulation

## Test Structure

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Load page → Filter by country → Filter by type → Enable comparison → View results
- Error state handling with retry functionality
- Empty state graceful handling
- Performance with 100+ packages
- Complete keyboard navigation flow

## Test Infrastructure

### Backend Testing Stack
- **Framework:** Bun Test (built into Bun runtime)
- **Mocking:** Built-in mock functions
- **HTTP Testing:** Supertest for integration tests
- **GraphQL:** Apollo Server test utilities

### Frontend Testing Stack
- **Framework:** Vitest
- **React Testing:** React Testing Library
- **User Interaction:** User Event
- **GraphQL Mocking:** Apollo Client MockedProvider
- **DOM Environment:** jsdom

### Test Utilities Created

1. **Apollo Mock Provider** (`src/test/apollo-mock.tsx`)
   - Simplifies GraphQL mocking for React components
   - Provides realistic mock data generators
   - Handles Apollo Client test configuration

2. **Test Server Builder** (`tests/utils/test-server.ts`)
   - Creates Apollo Server instances for integration testing
   - Handles dependency injection for testing
   - Provides test data factories

3. **Test Setup** (`src/test/setup.ts`)
   - Global test configuration
   - Mock implementations for browser APIs
   - Testing environment setup

## Running the Tests

### Backend Tests
```bash
# Run all backend tests
cd server/server
bun test

# Run specific test suites
bun test tests/unit/resolvers/airhalo-resolvers.test.ts
bun test tests/unit/airhalo-client/airhalo-client.test.ts
bun test tests/integration/airhalo-integration.test.ts
```

### Frontend Tests
```bash
# Install dependencies first (testing packages added)
cd client/apps/dashboard
npm install

# Run all frontend tests
npm test

# Run specific test files
npm test -- src/pages/pricing/__tests__/airhalo.test.tsx
npm test -- src/test/integration/airhalo-e2e.test.tsx

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch
```

## Test Coverage Goals

### Backend Coverage
- **Resolvers:** 100% line coverage, all error paths tested
- **Client:** 95%+ coverage including edge cases and error scenarios
- **Integration:** All GraphQL operations and error states

### Frontend Coverage
- **Components:** 85%+ line coverage, all user interactions
- **Integration:** Complete user journeys and error recovery
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance verification

## Continuous Integration

The tests are designed to run in CI environments without external dependencies:

1. **No Real API Calls:** All AirHalo API interactions are mocked
2. **Deterministic:** Tests use fixed mock data and controlled timing
3. **Fast Execution:** Unit tests complete in < 5 seconds, integration tests in < 30 seconds
4. **Parallel Safe:** Tests can run concurrently without interference

## Mock Data Strategy

### Realistic Test Data
- Mock data mirrors actual AirHalo API response structure
- Includes edge cases (unlimited data, multiple operators, various pricing models)
- Tests both success and error scenarios
- Covers different package types (LOCAL, REGIONAL, GLOBAL)

### Data Factories
- Reusable test data generators
- Configurable with overrides for specific test scenarios
- Consistent across unit, integration, and E2E tests

## Error Handling Testing

### Comprehensive Error Scenarios
1. **API Unavailable:** Network timeouts, service down
2. **Authentication Failures:** Invalid credentials, expired tokens
3. **Invalid Data:** Malformed responses, missing fields
4. **Rate Limiting:** API quota exceeded
5. **Client Errors:** Invalid parameters, missing required fields

### User Experience Focus
- Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- Retry mechanisms are tested and reliable
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Loading states are accessible and informative

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing Scenarios
- Large datasets (100+ packages)
- Rapid filter changes
- Memory usage monitoring
- Render performance tracking

### Accessibility Testing
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation
- ARIA labels and roles
- Color contrast and visual indicators

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Adding New Tests
1. Follow existing patterns for consistency
2. Update mock data when API schema changes
3. Test both happy path and error scenarios
4. Include accessibility considerations

### Updating Existing Tests
1. Maintain backward compatibility in mock data
2. Update integration tests when GraphQL schema changes
3. Verify E2E tests reflect actual user workflows
4. Keep test documentation current

## Benefits of This Testing Strategy

1. **Confidence:** Comprehensive coverage prevents regressions
2. **Development Speed:** Fast feedback loop during development
3. **Documentation:** Tests serve as living documentation
4. **Refactoring Safety:** Tests enable safe code changes
5. **User Experience:** E2E tests ensure features work end-to-end
6. **Accessibility:** Built-in a11y testing prevents accessibility issues

This testing strategy ensures the AirHalo integration is robust, maintainable, and provides an excellent user experience across all scenarios.
